# GrimByte ⚔️💀 – A CLI Dungeon Crawler WIP

Welcome to **GrimByte**, the ultimate CLI dungeon crawler (well… in theory 😅).  
Currently in a very early WIP stage, basically unplayable, but hey, the journey begins somewhere!

## About

GrimByte is a rogue-like adventure with:  

- Randomly generated maps
- Random monster, boss, and item pools
- ASCII graphics for that classic terminal nostalgia

Completely controllable via commands, so no fancy GUI distractions here.

## Features (coming soon)

- Fully random maps, monsters, bosses, and items  
- Complete command-based control  
- Save system to continue your epic (or tragic) run  
- Future conversion to a standalone executable  

## Status

🚧 Very early WIP – currently unplayable. Consider yourself warned!  

## License

No license yet – please don’t use it. It’s mine… for now 😎
